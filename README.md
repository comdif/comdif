- 👋 Hi, I’m Christian Zeler.
- 👀 I’m interested in technology and knowledge sharing.
I like simple, solid and pragmatic things, here you will only find basic code understandable by everyone.
No framework, no external libraries, no artificial bullshit, don't hesitate to add if endif else to my code to just create collective intelligence :-)
- 🌱 I’m currently working as consultant on various domains
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on nothing specific, I only work on what I like.
- 📫 How to reach me: christian@comdif.com
