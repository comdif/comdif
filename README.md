- 👋 Hi, I’m Christian Zeler.
- 👀 I'm interested in technology and knowledge sharing. I like things simple, concrete, and pragmatic. Here you'll find simple code that everyone can understand. No frameworks, no external libraries, no bullshit. Feel free to add if endif else statements to my code to create collective intelligence. :-)
- 🌱 I’m currently working as consultant on various domains
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on nothing specific, I only work on what I like.
- 📫 How to reach me: christian@comdif.com
